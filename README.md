# Citra archive by yuztra
An archive of Citra source code as of 3 March 2024 and binaries as of 21 September 2019.

Around March 2024, Nintendo decided to abuse their legal powers and take down Citra for good. It's really sad to see this big project get taken down, and I think it should be preserved.

## Note for Nintendo
I live in Indonesia, which is well outside your legal territory. So, if you are seeing this Nintendo, you can't do anything.
